# Installation

## Stable release

I'm actively working on creating excutables for download!

## From source

The source for PyChamber can be downloaded from
the [Github repo](https://github.com/hrg-lab/pychamber/).

You can either clone the public repository:

``` console
git clone git://github.com/hrg-lab/pychamber
```

Or download the tarball:

``` console
curl -OJL https://github.com/hrg-lab/pychamber/tarball/master
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/1.2/):

``` console
poetry install
```

  [pip]: https://pip.pypa.io
